The CSS gradient background on the canvas has been removed; the only canvas background effect is now drawn using the canvas context in JavaScript.\n3. The background conic-style gradient fills the triangle area inside the canvas, and the rest of the screen/background is a clean, solid color.\n4. The canvas is perfectly centered by CSS with no offsets or overrides from JavaScript.\n\nThis ensures:\n- Absolutely no extra gradient on the body or outside the triangle.\n- Thoroughly centered and responsive animation.\n\nReload your app to see the fix. If you need the triangle differently filled, let me know!",
