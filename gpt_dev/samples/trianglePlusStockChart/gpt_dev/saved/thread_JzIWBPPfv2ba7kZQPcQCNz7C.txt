This is implemented as follows:\n\n- **index.js:** Adds a new `initCssCircles()` function that creates a `#css-circles-container` div, inserts three `.gradient-circle` elements, and appends it to the body. This is called alongside your existing canvas function.\n- **index.css:** Adds styles for the new container and the animated, multi-sized circles, using a `conic-gradient` and CSS keyframe animation for smooth rotation.\n\n**These new circles are visually independent and do not interact with the canvas or its code.** All layout and animation is handled by CSS for performance.\n\n_You can easily adjust the number of circles or their styles by tweaking the provided CSS or JS._ If you need more interactivity, let me know!",

We'll set up the background as a radial rainbow, then animate it with filter: hue-rotate.\n\n**Here's what I will do:**\n- Update the CSS `.gradient-circle` to use a rainbow radial-gradient background.\n- Remove the conic-gradient and rotation animation.\n- Add a `@keyframes` animation to smoothly hue-rotate the circles.\n- Ensure each circle animates at a different speed.\n\nReady to proceed? (This accurately gives the desired \"light growing from the center with cycling colors.\")",

(The JS code forcibly jitters their scaling.)\n\n### 3. **Stock chart overlay**\n- A stock price chart (from Wikimedia: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Stock_Price_Chart.png) is floating over the rest of your visuals, semi-transparent and pointer-events: none.\n\n**You can further fine-tune the corners or replace the stock chart image link as needed.
